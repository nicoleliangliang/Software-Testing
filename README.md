Software Testing Assignments
============================

To view lecture notes for this course, please consult the
[wiki](https://github.com/skylerto/Software-Testing/wiki).

This course gives an introduction to systematic methods of testing and verification,
covering a range of static and dynamic techniques and their use within the development
process. The course emphasizes the view that design should be carried out with
verification in mind to achieve overall project goals.  

# Assignments

The term work (assignments) given, all have to do with different aspects of testing. We have chosen an open-source Java application as our system under test (SUT). The SUT is a maven project hosted on github, the [borg calendar](https://github.com/mikeberger/borg_calendar). As per our professors request, he asked us **not** to fill out bug reports for any of our findings.

## Bug Reports

The purpose of this assignment is to give us experience reporting bugs and developing test cases. This task will give you practice thinking how to develop a test case from a requirements document, what a professional bug report should be, as well as analyzing bugs before reporting them. The entire requirements document, [CSE4313_Assignment1Description.pdf](bug-reports/docs/CSE4313_Assignment1Description.pdf), and our [bug reports](bug-reports/docs/Report.pdf).

## Black Box Testing

The purpose of this assignment is to give us experience in applying the functional testing techniques we discussed in class, as well as creating automated test code with JUnit. Your task will be to create a test suite in JUnit for a system of your choice, produce bug reports (if any), and submit a written report describing your testing. The entire requirements document, [CSE4313_Assignment2Description.pdf](black-box/docs/CSE4313_Assignment2Description.pdf), and our black-box testing [report](black-box/docs/Report.pdf).

## White Box Testing

The purpose of this assignment is to give you experience applying path testing approaches and measuring coverage. Your task will be to create a test suite in JUnit, produce bug reports (if any), and submit a written report describing your testing.

## Assignment 4 (a4)

The purpose of this assignment is to give you experience applying data flow
testing, slice-based testing and mutation testing approaches. Your task will be
